The police have examined the deceased, and we have found that there are no signs of struggle or external injuries, nor are there any signs of drowning. We have four suspects; the housekeeper, the husband, the brother and the best friend.   \n\nAs I@ve mentioned earlier, we have narrowed it down to four rooms; the tea parlour, the reception hall, the smoking room, and, of course, the bathroom.

His position as a physician would make arsenic easily obtainable, but being as careless as to take the arsenic from his own bag without replacing it seems very out of order for such a clever man; surely, he would know the bag would be searched. He had, however, a strong motive, but since the testament only stated what would happen to the money at Sir Moore@s death, he thought that his father@s money was forever lost to him, and his sister@s death would not change that.",
      "Amongst the four suspects, it is evident that Mrs Hall did not commit the murder. She had no motive, and if anything, she knew she would suffer from losing her employer. As for Mr Dunham, the motive is fairly obvious; naturally, he thought the money was to go to him at the passing of his wife. Several clues establish that Mr Dunham has an affair with Miss Davis, something that is proven by the handkerchief he had dropped in the smoking room, which had a fading, yet distinct, smell of roses, when Mrs Dunham@s perfume of choice has been lavender for the last ten years, proving it could not possibly have been hers. However, his reaction shows that he could not have been in any way prepared for his wife@s passing and there isn@t enough evidence to connect him to the murder.",
      "That leaves us with only one possible explanation; Mary Davis did it. She murdered Margret Dunham, poisoned her with arsenic. Why? Well, the answer is rather simple; Mary Davis was jealous of Margret Dunham, jealous of her life. Being a dear childhood friend of Mrs Dunham, Mary Davis encountered the Moore fortune at a very young age. After quarrels, the two ladies reunited and Miss Davis was then told about Sir Moore@s tragic passing, and Mrs Dunham confided in a dear friend about the testament which granted her the entire Moore family fortune intact. Mary Davis figured that the money, naturally, was to go to Mr Dunham at the unfortunate event of his wife@s death, and this would have been very tempting for a woman like Miss Davis, whose family had a tragic past of gambling and debts, and being a clever woman, Miss Davis nestled her way into Mr Dunham@s heart.",
      "Her plan was to marry the handsome Mr Dunham once Margret Dunham was out the way and once the fortune had been taken over by her husband. To secure Mr Dunham@s heart, she could not hurry it, and took her time. I suppose all she had to do now, was to wait for the perfect moment. And indeed, that moment arose when she was invited to a weekend at Mr and Mrs Dunham@s, together with Mrs Dunham@s younger brother, Dr Jonathan Moore. That Jonathan Moore was a doctor, was of course nothing but to the greatest of advantages, as Mary Davis immediately thought of her long planned scenario of poison as her weapon of choice. The only problem Miss Davis seemed to face, was how to steal the flask of arsenic from Dr Moore@s bag, the physician@s bag he was known to always carry with him.",
      "On the day of the murder, however, Miss Davis offered to fetch Mr Dunham and Dr Moore from the smoking room to have a lovely lunch in the gardens. Before she could enter, Dr Moore rushed out of the room, seemingly upset, without his bag. Miss Davis then proceeded into the smoking room, only to find Mr Dunham left with a headache. After a short chat to calm the man down, they left the smoking room together. Miss Davis, however, stated that she had forgotten something in the smoking room and urged Mr Dunham to continue on without her. Alone in the room, she advanced to the bag Dr Moore had so fortunately forgotten in his hurry, and she stole the bottle of arsenic.",
      "Having obtained the murder weapon, Mary Davis now had to figure out a way of sneaking the poison into Mrs Dunham@s drink. This opportunity arose later on, when the men withdrew to the smoking room for some whiskey and a smoke, while the two women settled in the tea parlour for some tea and a chat. Miss Davis excused herself for a moment, to freshen up a bit, and snuck into the reception hall. Knowing that the housekeeper, Mrs Hall, is rather superstitious, Miss Davis hung some paintings askew and then violently smashed one of the French crystal vases on the floor, making a terribly loud noise, before hurrying away.",
      "Like clockwork, Mr and Mrs Dunham, together with Dr Moore, came running from one end, and Miss Davis disappeared at the other. While the three spectators were baffled by this, Mrs Hall came rushing in from the kitchen, shouting it was the ghost of the former master, and all the while, Miss Davis snuck into the kitchen and poured the arsenic into the tea pot, to frame the housekeeper for the gruesome act before rushing out to the others, as if she just came from the ladies@ room. All she had to do, was simply to make sure not to drink, herself, from the poisoned tea.",
      "It would indeed have been the perfect murder, had it not been for the clues left by the perpetrator. Miss Davis@s fatal mistake was dropping the bottle of arsenic from her sleeve when casually sitting down after the strange incident in the reception hall, and finding it helped us establish the cause of death, and the missing arsenic in the physician@s bag helped us determine that the arsenic had been obtained in the house, assuring that it must indeed have been one of our suspects committing the murder.",
      "The piece of torn lace found by the fireplace in the reception hall could have belonged to Mrs Hall, and might have been torn when cleaning the mess, but when looking closer at it, the finer materials show signs of a wealthier owner rather than a mere housekeeper, and i know for a fact that Mrs Dunham did not like lace and fancy dresses, which indicates that it must have been torn from Miss Davis@s dress, tying her to the smashing of the crystal vase as a manoeuvre to have time to sneak the poison into the tea pot.",
      "As for the handkerchief, that was indeed a rather tricky one. It was found tucked down in Mr Dunham@s armchair in the smoking room, and at first, i thought it to be a gift from Mrs Dunham, considering the initials M.D. However, it had a fading smell of roses, when Mrs Dunham always wore lavender. Considering the placement of the handkerchief, i could determine that it must have been worn by Mr Dunham, making it an item important enough to carry around$perhaps a token given to him by a woman some time ago, considering the fading smell, as something for him to remember her by whenever they could not meet.",
      "The initials, M.D, is also Mary Davis@s initials, and connecting it with her very rosy perfume, it proves that Miss Davis has an affair with the victim@s husband, the very same man she believed was to receive the money once the Mrs was deceased. And to strengthen her motive, the testament of the late Sir Moore$the very testament Mr Dunham and Dr Moore had a violent argument about earlier that day$was found exposed in the smoking room.",
      "This leads me to the last piece of evidence, which is the tea cups found in the tea parlour. Though it is unfortunate that many of the servants were ill, which forced Mrs Hall to do most of the work that night, i are very grateful that she had not yet fetched the dishes from the parlour, because when i found the cups, i immediately thought it strange that only one of the cups had been drunken from$Mrs Dunham@s. Of course, i wondered why$Miss Davis claimed the tea to be cold, but since Mrs Dunham drank it all, it could not have been that very bad$but after a chemical examination of the tea from Miss Davis@s cup, i could establish that it did indeed contain arsenic.",
      "Miss Davis poisoned her friend out of greed and jealousy; she had always wanted the life of Mrs Dunham, and had always envied her for the riches and the power the woman possessed. I suppose a bit less... glamorous life, awaits her now."
